## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Data Stored Only on Your Device (Local Storage)

The app stores the following data **only on your device** using local storage (e.g., Android/iOS device storage). This data is **not** sent to our servers (we do not operate any user data servers):

- **Game progress:** high score, total coins, unlocked and equipped skins, challenge progress (e.g., score multiplier, challenge group index), and lifetime statistics (games played, total score, near-misses).
- **Settings:** sound on/off, music on/off, haptics on/off, theme (light/dark/system), and language (locale).
- **Ad-related counter:** number of game overs since the last interstitial ad (used only to decide when to show an ad).

We do **not** collect your name, email, phone number, photo, or any other personally identifiable information (PII).

### 1.2 Data We Do Not Collect

We do **not** collect, store, or transmit:

- Name, email address, or contact information  
- Phone number, device identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID, IMEI, MAC address) for purposes of tracking or advertising  
- Location data  
- Photos, camera, or microphone data  
- Any personal or sensitive information from children

## 2. Advertising (Google AdMob)

One Tap Dodge shows ads provided by **Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)**. We use:

- **Rewarded video ads:** optional ad to revive after a game over (user chooses to watch).
- **Interstitial ads:** full-screen ads shown after some game overs (e.g., every few rounds), not at app launch.

Because our app is directed at children and families:

- We have configured our app so that **all ad requests are tagged for child-directed treatment** (COPPA) and for **under-age-of-consent treatment** (GDPR/EEA) where applicable.
- We request only **G-rated** ad content (appropriate for general audiences, including children).
- We do **not** use interest-based advertising or remarketing for our app’s ad traffic; ad serving for this app is not based on behavioral profiling of users.

Google may collect and process data in accordance with its own policies when serving ads. For more information, see:

- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)  
- [Google Play Families – Ads and monetization](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9893335)  

We do **not** control Google’s data practices. We do not sell any user data to advertisers or any third party.

## 3. Children’s Privacy (COPPA / Families)

One Tap Dodge is designed to be suitable for users of all ages, including children under 13. We are committed to complying with:

- **Google Play Families Policy**  
- **U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)**  
- **EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and applicable local laws  

We do **not** knowingly collect personal information from children. The only data we handle is stored locally on the device (game progress and settings) and is not used to identify or contact anyone. Our advertising is configured for child-directed and family-safe treatment as described in Section 2.

If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at **[YOUR CONTACT EMAIL]** and we will address your request.

---

## 4. Data Sharing and Sale

- We **do not sell** any user data.  
- We **do not share** your locally stored game data with third parties; it remains on your device.  
- The only third party that may receive data in the context of our app is **Google** (via the Google Mobile Ads SDK), in accordance with Google’s privacy policy and ad policies. We do not pass any personal or identifying information to Google beyond what the SDK uses for ad delivery under child-directed and G-rated settings.

---

## 5. Data Security and Retention

- Data stored by the app is kept only on your device.  
- You can delete all app data by uninstalling the app or clearing the app’s data in your device settings.  
- We do not retain user data on our own servers.

---

## 6. Your Rights (e.g., GDPR)

Depending on your location, you may have the right to access, correct, or delete personal data. Because we do not collect or store personal data on our servers, the only data we “process” is the local data on your device. You can:

- **Delete app data:** Uninstall the app or clear the app’s data in your device settings to remove all locally stored data.  
- **Contact us:** For any privacy-related request or question, contact us at **[YOUR CONTACT EMAIL]**.

---

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” and “Effective date” at the top will be revised when we make changes. Continued use of the app after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. For material changes, we may provide additional notice (e.g., in the app or on the store listing) where appropriate.
